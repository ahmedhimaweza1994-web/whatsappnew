You have the updated WhatsApp Export Viewer app. The user tested with a .zip, and parsing/auth/responsiveness are working well (messages extract correctly, Arabic RTL partial, media placeholders show). However, two key UI issues remain in the chat window, as shown in the test output below.

### Observed Issues (From Test Chat):
1. **Message Bubbles Alignment**: All messages are displayed left-aligned in a single column. In WhatsApp style, they should be divided: Right-aligned bubbles for messages from the user/me ("Eugene Prime" or "You"), left-aligned for the other party ("+966 54 943 4931"). Use distinct styles (e.g., green background with rounded tail on right, white/gray on left) for visual distinction, with timestamps on the right side.

2. **Media Rendering**: Messages with media show only text placeholders like "IMG-20250708-WA0029.jpg (الملف مرفق)" or "PTT-20250708-WA0053.opus (الملف مرفق)", but no actual media displays inline in the chat. Media should render directly: Images as clickable inline <img> with zoom, voice notes (OPUS) as <audio controls> player, videos as <video> with play button, and documents as download links. Add thumbnails for loading states, and a "Media Gallery" button in the header for a full grid view per chat. Ensure media URLs from extracted zip are blob: or local for offline.

Test Chat Example (Extracted Messages – Use This for Verification):
- FEBRUARY 8, 2025
  - Eugene Prime (right bubble): "كلمني الصبح لو فاضي" at 6:14 AM.
  - Eugene Prime (right): "كله تمام الحمد لله" at 6:14 AM.
  - ... (multiple from Eugene Prime).
- AUGUST 7, 2025
  - +966 54 943 4931 (left): "انت مسحت حساب المسنجر" at 4:50 PM.
  - Eugene Prime (right): "لو سمحت متعرفش حد..." at 4:51 PM.
  - +966 54 943 4931 (left): "خير ابنى فين ايه ؟" at 5:58 PM.
  - Eugene Prime (right): "رحت مستشفي احمد ماهر..." at 6:01 PM.
  - +966 54 943 4931 (left): "الف سلامة" at 6:01 PM.
  - Eugene Prime (right): "شكرا يا ابيه" at 6:02 PM.
  - +966 54 943 4931 (left): "IMG-20250708-WA0029.jpg (الملف مرفق)" at 6:02 PM → Render image inline.
  - +966 54 943 4931 (left): "PTT-20250708-WA0030.opus (الملف مرفق)" at 6:02 PM → Render audio player.
  - ... (continue to 141 messages, with more media like PTT-20250708-WA0053.opus at 12:58 AM on AUGUST 8).

After fixes, the chat should look exactly like WhatsApp: Alternating bubbles, media embedded in flow (e.g., image below the sender's timestamp), smooth scrolling, and responsive (stacked on mobile).

Update the ChatWindow component, MessageBubble, and media rendering logic. Provide full updated code for affected files (e.g., components/ChatWindow.js, utils/mediaHandler.js). Add any needed CSS (Tailwind classes for alignment: ml-auto for right, mr-auto for left). Test: Load the sample chat from zip, verify 141 messages with proper alignment/media, no placeholders—actual renders. Keep all prior features (search, export, auth).
